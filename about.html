			<p>BusIt is a student led business determined to improve your daily bus commute. We recognize the struggle of getting from A to B that most of us must deal with every day. Taking the bus is one of the most prominent solutions to this problem; unfortunately, this is not a perfect solution. Often people will find themselves being late for work because of their bus running behind or ahead of schedule. With our service, you will be able to track every operating bus in your area in real time. Finally, you will be able know exactly when your bus will arrive instead of just knowing when it should arrive.</p>
