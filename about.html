		<p>BusIt is a student led business determined to improve your daily bus commute. We recognize the struggle of getting from <br>
		A to B that most of us must deal with every day. Taking the bus is one of the most prominent solutions to this problem; <br>
		unfortunately, this is not a perfect solution. Often people will find themselves being late for work because of their bus <br>
		running behind or ahead of schedule. With our service, you will be able to track every operating bus in your area in real <br>
		time. Finally, you will be able know exactly when your bus will arrive instead of just knowing when it should arrive.</p>

		<p>We are excited to announce our plans to implement a way for you to pay for transit by using an NCF card on your mobile <br>
 		phone. This card would be connected to an account on our website where you would be able to add funds to a secured balance.</p>
